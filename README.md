## Notes

- [Is it safe to expose Firebase apiKey to the public?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37482366/is-it-safe-to-expose-firebase-apikey-to-the-public/37484053#37484053)
- -[Loading Spinners](https://loading.io/css/)
- We can also embed Svelte components instead of creating an entire "Svelte-only" app.
- The core idea behind this approach is simply not control your entire page via Svelte components but only parts of the page.
- Why and where would you maybe use such an approach?
  - Existing (server-side rendered) pages that you don't want to turn in Svelte Single-Page-Apps - instead you might want to add some dynamic elements (e.g. a Svelte-controlled Dropdown button)
  - Web apps (SPA or not) that are generally controlled via another framework or library (e.g. via React) - you could still take over control of a part of the page via Svelte components
- However, most apps will be Single Page Apps (i.e. you control the entire page via Svelte) - it's still worth noting that you're not forced to build such an app though.
